== General ==

There are many ways to contribute back to the project, from easiest to hardest:

 * post a message to the [https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/ci-framework list], give as much detail as possible, we'll figure out where it goes and reply back with the github ticket numbers
 * log an [https://github.com/collectiveintel/cif-v1/issues issue]  (with as much detail as possible, etc)
 * log a ticket to the specific repo if you know where it goes (eg: you know the bug is in cif-smrt, etc)
 * fork the v1 branch in the repo (eg: cif-smrt/tree/v1), fix, submit a pull-req (keep them as small and specific as possible)
