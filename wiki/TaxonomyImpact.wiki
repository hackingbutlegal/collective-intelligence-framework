= Details =

== Assessments ==
=== Botnet ===
 * typically a host used to control another host or malicious process
 * matching traffic would usually indicate infection
 * typically used to identify compromised hosts
 * typically [TaxonomySeverity#High high severity] in nature

=== Malware / Exploit ===
 * typically a host used to exploit and/or drop malware to a host for the first time
 * not a botnet C&C
 * typically used in preemptive blocking, alerts may not indicate infection was successful
 * typically [TaxonomySeverity#Medium medium severity] in nature

=== Phishing ===
 * a luring attempt at a victim to exfiltrate some sort of credential
 * a targeted attempt at getting someone to unintentionally cause infection (spear phishing)
 * typically [TaxonomySeverity#Medium medium severity] in nature

=== Networks ===
 * typically a rogue, hijacked, bullet-proof or known criminal network
 * typically [TaxonomySeverity#Medium medium severity] in nature

=== Nameserver ===
 * typically a rogue or criminally negligent name-server
 * typically [TaxonomySeverity#Medium medium severity] in nature
 * depicts a name-server where blocking direct access to the server should mitigate future compromises

=== Fastflux ===
 * typically describing a botnet profile
 * typically [TaxonomySeverity#High high severity] in nature

=== Scanner ===
 * typically infrastructure being used to scan or brute-force (ssh, rdp, telnet, etc...)

=== Spam ===
 * typically infrastructure being used to facilitate the sending of spam

=== Searches ===
 * identify's that someone searched for something of possible significance
 * typically [TaxonomySeverity#Low low severity] in nature

=== Whitelist ===
 * denotes that specific entity (usually an address) should be considered harmless in nature
 * denotes that blocking an entity would result in mass collateral damage (eg: yahoo virtually hosted services)
 * confidence should be applied to each entry to help calculate risk associated with whitelist
  *[TaxonomySeverity#Null Null severity] in nature

== Types ==
=== Infrastructure ===
 * describes an object of which is being used as a platform for an attack
 * usually denotes an ipv4/ipv6 address or prefix
 * may denote an ASN (bgp)
 * synonymous with "the bad guys drove down route 66 to get to the bank they robbed", where route 66 is the infrastructure used to launch an attack.
 * "the bad guys used 1.2.3.4 to control their botnet"

=== Domain ===
 * any 1...n level TLD to describe the use of the domain name system
 * could include a FQDN, could be a name-server, could be a .tld itself (eg: .co.cc or just .cc)

=== Url ===
 * any specific universal locator used an an attack
