= Details =
== Botnet ==
 * typically a host used to control another host or malicious process
 * matching traffic would usually indicate infection
 * typically used to identify compromised hosts
 * typically [TaxonomySeverity#High high severity] in nature

== Malware / Exploit ==
 * typically a host used to exploit and/or drop malware to a host for the first time
 * not a botnet C&C
 * typically used in preemptive blocking, alerts may not indicate infection was successful
 * typically [TaxonomySeverity#Medium medium severity] in nature

== Phishing ==
 * a luring attempt at a victim to exfiltrate some sort of credential
 * a targeted attempt at getting someone to unintentionally cause infection (spear phishing)
 * typically [TaxonomySeverity#Medium medium severity] in nature

== Networks ==
 * typically a rogue, hijacked, bullet-proof or known criminal network
 * typically [TaxonomySeverity#Medium medium severity] in nature

== Nameserver ==
 * typically a rogue or criminally negligent name-server
 * typically [TaxonomySeverity#Medium medium severity] in nature
 * depicts a name-server where blocking direct access to the server should mitigate future compromises

== Fastflux ==
 * typically describing a botnet profile
 * typically [TaxonomySeverity#High high severity] in nature

== Scanner ==
 * typically infrastructure being used to scan or brute-force (ssh, rdp, telnet, etc...)

== Spam ==

== Searches ==
 * identify's that someone searched for something of possible significance

== Whitelist ==
 * denotes that specific entity (usually an address) should be considered harmless in nature
 * denotes that blocking an entity would result in mass collateral damage (eg: yahoo virtually hosted services)
 * confidence should be applied to each entry to help calculate risk associated with whitelist
 * [TaxonomySeverity#Null Null severity] in nature
