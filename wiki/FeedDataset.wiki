This describes the various dynamically generated data-sets within the framework. These data-sets can be used as:

 * IDS rules
 * name-server zones
 * firewall rules
 * and more...

== Infrastructure ==
=== Botnet ===
==== Description ====
Typically a "high severity" data-set, meaning, if combined with a high-confidence observation, it's very likely you'll need to take action.
==== Examples ====
===== API =====
{{{
GET https://cif.example.com:443/api/infrastructure/botnet?confidence=95
GET https://cif.example.com:443/api/infrastructure/botnet?confidence=85
GET https://cif.example.com:443/api/infrastructure/botnet?confidence=40
}}}

===== CLI =====
{{{
$ cif -q infrastructure/botnet -c 95
$ cif -q infrastructure/botnet -c 85
}}}

=== Malware / Exploit ===
==== Description ====
Typically a "medium severity" data-set, meaning, if combined with a high-confidence observation, it's a good candidate for blocking to mitigate infection.

==== Examples ====
===== API =====
{{{
GET https://cif.example.com:443/api/infrastructure/malware?confidence=95&severity=medium
GET https://cif.example.com:443/api/infrastructure/malware?confidence=85&severity=medium
GET https://cif.example.com:443/api/infrastructure/malware?confidence=40&severity=medium
}}}

===== CLI =====
{{{
$ cif -q infrastructure/malware -c 95 -s medium
$ cif -q infrastructure/malware -c 85 -s medium
}}}
