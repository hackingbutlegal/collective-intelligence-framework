#summary describes the various taxonomy's used through the framework

= Introduction =

Throughout this framework, severity, confidence and impact are used to describe our observations. The combination of all three help to define how the data should be treated and what should be done operationally. These taxonomies are important in defining your risk tolerance and the balance between "false positives" and pre-emptive mitigation.

= Details =

== Severity ==
[TaxonomySeverity Severity] describes the seriousness of an observation. A sort of "pain scale".

== Confidence ==
[TaxonomyConfidence Confidence] describes how confidence we are in our observation (0-100, 0-low, 100-high).

== Assessment/Impact ==
[TaxonomyImpact Impact] describes the profile of actor we're dealing with (botnet infrastructure, phishing domain, etc)
