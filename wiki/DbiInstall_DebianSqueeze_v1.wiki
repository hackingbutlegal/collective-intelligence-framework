== Caveats ==
=== Minimal Debian ===
Minimal Debian does not come with sudo or the normal version of vim. If you used the net boot version of the debian installer, you'll need to install these as root:
{{{
$ aptitude -y install sudo vim
}}}
== Dependencies Installation ==
----
 # install the [ClientInstall_v1 client]
 # install the base deps
{{{
$ sudo aptitude -y install postgresql-client libclass-dbi-perl libdbd-pg-perl
}}}
 # Install the remaining CPAN modules
{{{
$ sudo PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT=1 perl -MCPAN -e 'install Net::DNS::Match'
}}}
