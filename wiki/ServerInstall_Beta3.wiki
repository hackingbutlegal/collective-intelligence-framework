this page describes the Beta3 Server Installation

= THIS PAGE UNDER CONSTRUCTION =

= Preamble =
These scripts do a lot of dns queries. You're gonna wanna install bind and configure it to use forwarders. Maybe something like google public dns to help mask your queries. Then point your resolv.conf to localhost

Once installed, monitor your dns traffic a bit, your server will be looking up some interesting information. Get a good handle on this and work with your security teams to whitelist this server.

= System Requirements =
These requirements will handle everything on the same box pretty well with the default open source data-sets. The more (bigger) data-sets you add, the more ram / disk space you'll need. The more cores you add, the more threads that can "batch out" the feed parsers (thus, resulting in faster data consumption).

These specs will handle around 10k feeds at once with minimal impact on memory usage. Past that you'll need to start doubling your specs. Virtual machine technology is great for prototyping your implementation and will give you a good baseline of what you'll need for production.
