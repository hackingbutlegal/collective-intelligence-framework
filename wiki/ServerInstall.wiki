= Preamble =
 * CIF is considered a technology demo. Although most working bits are considered stable for production use, there are many known architectural limitations that are being worked out in the next release (~ 2013)
  * the code is written in perl (bad threading, slow)
  * the database is embedded in postgres instead of something like hbase
  * the technology was written to be embedded as a single server, instead of an agent / manager / database relationship setup

 * These scripts do a lot of dns queries. You're gonna wanna install bind and configure it to use forwarders. Maybe something like google public dns to help mask your queries. Then point your resolv.conf to localhost

 * Once installed, monitor your dns traffic a bit, your server will be looking up some interesting information. Get a good handle on this and work with your security teams to whitelist this server.

 * This framework was developed against debian (lenny, squeeze and ubuntu > 10.10 or so). This has *NOT* been tested against any other distro's yet (RHEL, BSD, etc). Purely due to lack of cycles. Look here for new doc to pop up when that's complete (or help us write it).

= System Requirements =
These requirements will handle everything on the same box pretty well with the default open source data-sets. The more (bigger) data-sets you add, the more ram / disk space you'll need. The more cores you add, the more threads that can "batch out" the feed parsers (thus, resulting in faster data consumption).

These specs will handle around 10k feeds at once with minimal impact on memory usage. Past that you'll need to start doubling your specs. Virtual machine technology is great for prototyping your implementation and will give you a good baseline of what you'll need for production.

 # an x86-64bit platform
 # at-least 8GB ram
 # at-least 4 cores
 # at-least 100GB of free (after OS install) disk space, which will last you about 6-9 months.

= Prerequisites =
== Required Services ==
 # Join the [http://groups.google.com/group/ci-framework mailing list] -- we like to archive the Q and A there. When you ask questions directly, I will usually Cc my responses.
 # DiskLayout
 # PostgresInstall
 # BindSetup

== System Deps ==
=== Stable ===
 # [ServerInstall_Lenny Debian Lenny]
 # [ServerInstall_Squeeze Debian Squeeze]
=== Unstable ===
 # [ServerInstall_Generic From Source]
 # [ServerInstall_Ubuntu10 Ubuntu v10]
 # [ServerInstall_CentOS6 CentOS 6]

= Install =
== Known Issues ==
 # If you've modified anything other than /opt/cif/etc/custom.cfg in /opt/cif/etc, *BACK UP YOUR etc/cif* directory. This install will overwrite all the main .cfg files
 # *IF YOU'RE USING A PREVIOUS VERSION OF CIF*, you'll need to drop your database, including any apikeys you've generated. Make sure you back up your apikeys table using pg_dump, you can then re-import the apikeys once the new database has been setup.
 # we're using postgres as an embedded db, these current configs assume your postgres instance is locked down from the outside world. This will be changed in future releases.

== Server ==
 # create the index / archive table spaces if you haven't via DiskLayout already (it's OK if you don't want to use LVM, these directories can exist on your root volume if you choose, but performance will increase if these are spread out across many disks):
{{{
$ sudo mkdir /mnt/archive
$ sudo mkdir /mnt/index
$ sudo chown postgres:postgres /mnt/index
$ sudo chown postgres:postgres /mnt/archive
$ sudo chmod 770 /mnt/index

 # install the PerlClient (we use some functions in it for the server)
 # create your "cif" user/group (the configure script will default to this user "cif")
