*BY DEFAULT, ALL QUERIES ARE ANONYMOUSLY LOGGED*

When performing a query, your apikey is hashed (sha1-uuid) and the basics of your search are logged by the system.  This allows others to see when there might be interest in a specific piece of intelligence, but not necessarily any concreate "feed" type data. Searches show up like this:
{{{
$ cif -q example.com
Query: example.com
Feed Restriction: RESTRICTED
Feed Created: 2011-01-20T15:44:14Z
