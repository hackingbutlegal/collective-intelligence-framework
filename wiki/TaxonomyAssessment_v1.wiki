#labels Version-1

= Introduction =


= Native Assessments =
== Botnet ==
 * typically a host used to control another host or malicious process
 * matching traffic would usually indicate infection
 * typically used to identify compromised hosts

== Malware  ==
The malware assessment depicts:

 * typically a host used to exploit and/or drop malware to a host for the first time
 * typically NOT a botnet controller (although they could overlap)
 * communications with these indicators may lead to a compromise and then to a possible botnet controller communication (if the infection was successful).
 * typically used in preemptive blocking, alerts may not indicate infection was successful

Typical examples might include items from:

 * http://www.malwaredomains.com

== Phishing ==
The phishing assessment depicts:

 * a luring attempt at a victim to exfiltrate some sort of credential
 * a targeted attempt at getting someone to unintentionally cause infection (spear phishing)

Typical examples might include items from:

 * http://www.phishtank.com

== Networks ==
 * typically a rogue, hijacked, bullet-proof or known criminal network

== Nameserver ==
 * typically a rogue or criminally negligent name-server
 * depicts a name-server where blocking direct access to the server should mitigate future compromises

== Fastflux ==
 * typically describing a botnet profile

== Scanner ==
The scanner assessment depicts:

 * typically infrastructure being used to scan or brute-force (ssh, rdp, telnet, etc...)

Typical examples might include observations from:

 * http://sshbl.org
 * http://dragonresearchgroup.org/insight/sshpwauth.txt

== Spam ==
The spam assessment depicts:

 * typically infrastructure being used to facilitate the sending of spam

== Searches ==
The search assessment depicts: 

 * identify's that someone searched for something of possible significance

== Suspicious ==
 * Unknown assessment

== Whitelist ==
 * denotes that specific entity (usually an address) should be considered harmless in nature
 * denotes that blocking an entity would result in mass collateral damage (eg: yahoo virtually hosted services)
 * confidence should be applied to each entry to help calculate risk associated with whitelist
