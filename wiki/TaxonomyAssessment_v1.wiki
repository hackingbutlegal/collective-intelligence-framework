= Introduction =

CIF has the capability to [ServerInstall_v1#Enabling_Feed_Generation generate feeds] of threat intelligence from the ingested threat intelligence. Feeds are generated by type, assessment and confidence. 

= Native Assessments =
== Botnet ==
 * typically a host used to control another host or malicious process
 * matching traffic would usually indicate infection
 * typically used to identify compromised hosts

== Malware  ==
 * typically a host used to exploit and/or drop malware to a host for the first time
 * not a botnet C&C
 * typically used in preemptive blocking, alerts may not indicate infection was successful

== Phishing ==
 * a luring attempt at a victim to exfiltrate some sort of credential
 * a targeted attempt at getting someone to unintentionally cause infection (spear phishing)

== Networks ==
 * typically a rogue, hijacked, bullet-proof or known criminal network

== Nameserver ==
 * typically a rogue or criminally negligent name-server
 * depicts a name-server where blocking direct access to the server should mitigate future compromises

== Fastflux ==
 * typically describing a botnet profile

== Scanner ==
 * typically infrastructure being used to scan or brute-force (ssh, rdp, telnet, etc...)

== Spam ==
 * typically infrastructure being used to facilitate the sending of spam

== Passive ==
 * a passive dns record (e.g. example.com was seen with an A record of 1.1.1.1)

== Searches ==
 * identify's that someone searched for something of possible significance

== Suspicious ==
 * Unknown assessment

== Whitelist ==
 * denotes that specific entity (usually an address) should be considered harmless in nature
 * denotes that blocking an entity would result in mass collateral damage (eg: yahoo virtually hosted services)
 * confidence should be applied to each entry to help calculate risk associated with whitelist
