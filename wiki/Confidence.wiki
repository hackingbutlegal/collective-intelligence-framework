#this page describes how we manually determine confidence (for now)

= Introduction =

See the official [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5070#section-3.10.4 IODEF] confidence class.

= Details =

== 0 - 39 ==
 * typically machine generated / enumerated data
 * examples include:
  * auto-enumerated name-servers from domains
  * infrastructure resolved from domain data

== 41 - 74 ==
 * typically machine generated data
 * some feeds might fall in the category if the author is lazy, or trying to cram too much into the feed
 * examples might include a domains list where the author is simply taking a botnet urls list and posting just the domains as a feed

== 75 - 84 ==
 * data that has under-gone *some* either machine or human vetting (eg: checked against a whitelist automatically)

== 85 - 94 ==

== 95 - 100 ==
 * reserved for data that has been humanly vetted
 * proven to be consistent for more than 2 years
 * very specific data (eg: ip+port+protocol, or a specific url, or malware hash)
