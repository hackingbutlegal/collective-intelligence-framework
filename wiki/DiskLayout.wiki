#this page describes the best layout for your system disk and data-warehouse

= Introduction =

Disk layout is important, all the way down to the way you raid out your physical drives. On top of that, you should use LVM where-ever possible in case you run out of space. By default, the best bang for your buck is RAID5, as it will give you a good combination of performance and redundancy.

Where possible, you should:

 # mirror the main OS on it's own set of disks
 # mirror the main archive table space on it's own set of disks (it will be smaller than all the index tables, which can be rebuilt from the archive
 # RAID5 or even RAID0 the archive index table space
 # RAID5 or RAID0 the main database index table space (table indicies)

}}}
== Partition Mapping ==
 1. your index should grow at a rate of 85-88% of your archive
 1. the archive partition should be about 53% of your disk
 1. the index logical volume should be about 47% of your disk

 1. for 1GB of free space:
  * 530MB for the archive
  * 470MB for your index
