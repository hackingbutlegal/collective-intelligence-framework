The cif-protocol is a low level encapsulation protocol that enables the transport of CIF messages throughout the framework. This protocol defines two types of objects, a top level raw 'msg' object, which acts like an envelope, as well as a 'feed' object that encapsulates feeds of data.

A current version of the protocol can be found [https://github.com/collectiveintel/cif-protocol/tree/v1 here]

= Details =
== !MessageType ==
----
The [https://github.com/collectiveintel/cif-protocol/blob/v1/src/msg.proto 'MessageType'] acts as an envelope to other data. It is used to convey if the message is a 'query', a 'submission', or a data 'reply'. It also contains the apikey and any status information needed to execute the transaction.

=== !StatusType ===
Represents result information pertaining to the transaction. Valid values:
 * SUCCESS
 * FAILED
 * UNAUTHORIZED

=== MsgType ===
Represents the type of message being transmitted. Valid values:
 * QUERY
 * SUBMISSION
 * REPLY

=== !QueryStruct ===

== !FeedType ==
----
The [https://github.com/collectiveintel/cif-protocol/blob/v1/src/feed.proto 'FeedType'] represents a dataset or contiguous set of records. It wraps these in a set of metadata such as confidence, description, restriction, reporttime, etc. It's also responsible for conveying the 'restriction map' and 'group map' back to the client. A 'FeedType' blob will be encapsulated in a 'MessageType' message.
