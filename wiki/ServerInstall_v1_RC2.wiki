#summary the Server Installation (v1)

* Before you Begin *
 * If you've never used CIF before, *STOP RIGHT HERE*, please see the [ServerInstall_v0 v0 installer] which is considered stable
 * From this point on, ignore all other doc (including any client side doc), this page includes all the doc required to test v1 and it could conflict with other doc creating confusion, pain and potential alcohol abuse..

= Preamble =
----
A semi-complete [ChangeLog_v1 ChangeLog] of v1

== Known Issues ==
=== v0 Compatibility ==
 * You *cannot* run this beta on the same box as CIF v0, it will break stuff, you will loose your data, you will be angry with me.
 * older cif clients (v0, v1_RC1) will not work with this current versions of CIF, this release assumes you're testing an instance where the cif client and the server are on the same hardware. we're working on packaging of the libcif library (the client) to be an independent install for the next release.
 * If you try to run CIF v1 while watching [http://www.jibjab.com/view/coepggrUTQOmCSW6FZrBSg?mt=1 this], it might not install correctly.
=== Upgrading ===
 * If you are installing on top of any of the previous CIF v1 releases, you *must drop* your cif v1 database before installing this release candidate.

== System Requirements ==
These requirements will handle everything on the same box pretty well with the default open source data-sets. The more (bigger) data-sets you add, the more ram / disk space you'll need. The more cores you add, the more threads that can "batch out" the feed parsers (thus, resulting in faster data consumption).

These specs will handle around 10k feeds at once with minimal impact on memory usage. Past that you'll need to start doubling your specs. Virtual machine technology is great for prototyping your implementation and will give you a good baseline of what you'll need for production.

=== Small Install ===
----
 * an x86-64bit platform (vm or bare-metal)
 * at-least 4GB ram
 * at-least 2 cores
 * at-least 100GB of free (after OS install) disk space, which should allow you to retain a years worth of data.

=== Large Install ===
----
 * an x86-64bit platform (bare-metal)
 * at-least 16GB ram
 * at-least 16 cores
 * at-least 500GB of free (after OS install) disk space, which should allow you to retain a years worth of data.
 * RAID + LVM knowledge

= Setup =
== Choose an operating system ==
----
Debian is the operating system in which CIF is developed against and is the most commonly used. A RHEL derivative is the second most common platform used by the community. 

In theory any current Unix/Linux operating system should be able to run CIF. The challenge may be installing the required applications and dependencies.

== Disk Layout ==
----
Consult the Disk Layout Guide before setting up your operating system. There are implications as to how this is done based on which type of install is opted for. Larger install's with LVM require a bit more configuration than a small install.

 # [DiskLayout_v1 Disk Layout Guide]

== Required applications and dependencies ==
----
Choose the distribution you used as your base operating system and install the required applications and dependencies.

 * [ServerInstall_v1_Squeeze Debian Squeeze] (unstable)
 * [ServerInstall_v1_Ubuntu Ubuntu 12.04 ] (testing)
 * [ServerInstall_v1_CentOS6 CentOS 6] (testing)

== Postgres, Bind and Resolvconf configuration ==
----
=== Bind ===
Configure Bind to use Google public DNS servers to push domain name resolution upstream.
 # [BindSetup_v1 BindSetup]

=== Postgres ===
Configure Postgres authentication and performance tuning
 # [PostgresInstall_v1 PostgresSetup]

== Installing CIF ==
----
This release assumes that the client is on the same hardware as the backend server/router components. The final release will include an independent "libcif" (the client libraries) package. This release is for *testing purposes only*... you have been warned...

== Enabling Feed Generation ==
To enable feed generation, which requires more space a few more options need to be ticked. If you only plan to leverage the system for "querying" (not putting feeds into something like a firewall, etc) then this section can be skipped.

 # modify the 'cif' user's ~/.cif config accordingly:
{{{
$ vi ~/.cif

feeds = infrastructure,domain,url,email,search,malware

roles = role_everyone

# how far back in time to generate the feeds from

 # generate a "role key" for generating feeds everyone (with an apikey) in the system can query for. They apikey generated can be ignored as it's just a placeholder for the system.
