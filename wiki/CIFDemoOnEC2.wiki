#summary Trying out CIF on Amazon's EC2

= Introduction =

These instructions are for launching a demo EC2 instance of CIF. The image in its default configuration is not meant for production because it has limited disk space. 

= Details =

Currently, the only public AMI is available in the East(Virginia) availability zone. 
The AMI ID is *ami-b014b5d9*. 

For instructions on launching an EC2 instance, follow the instructions from Amazon's site [http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/GettingStartedGuide/GetStartedLinux.html]. Once at the *Launch an Instance* step, use the *Classic Wizard* and search for the AMI ID (*ami-b014b5d9*) in the *Community AMIs* tab. 

The only inbound ports that need to be permitted in the security group are TCP 443 for access to the CIF API and TCP 22 for SSH access.
