= Whitelisting =

CIFv1 has the capability to whitelist observations from entering a feed during the feed generation process. 

=== How does whitelisting work in CIFv1? ===

Any observation (IP, domain, URL) with the following will be whitelisted during feed generation: 

 * Assessment = whitelist
 * Confidence >= 25

=== How does an observation get an assessment of "whitelist" and a confidece >= 25? ===

By default CIFv1 is configured with the following whitelists:

 1. https://github.com/collectiveintel/cif-smrt-rules/blob/v1/etc/00_alexa_whitelist.cfg
 1. https://github.com/collectiveintel/cif-smrt-rules/blob/v1/etc/00_mirc_whitelist.cfg
 1. https://github.com/collectiveintel/cif-smrt-rules/blob/v1/etc/00_whitelist.cfg
 
Looking at the 00_whitelist.cfg file you'll see there are additional configuration files that contribute to whitelisting.
