 # Think before you post
 # Topics should be focused around the development of, integration of CIF and a-like technologies
 # Vendors ARE more than welcome, ultimately we want integration, this is how we train you to be better
 # NO Sales Pitches for non-open source, freely available software unless it's directly relevant to CIF or CIF integration.
 # Vendors SHALL NOT compare their products to another in this forum (you have a website; you may do it there)
# Vendors that leverage the CIF community as a means for "cold-calling" it's members, at the discretion of the moderators will be banned.
 # we reserve the right to kick anyone off the list for these reasons or any other reason deemed by the moderators / community at-large
