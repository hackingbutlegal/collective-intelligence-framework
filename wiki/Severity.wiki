This page discusses the Severity values for intelligence records

= High =
 * denotes that the record (or feed) has a very (virtually nill) low false positive rate
 * the record is usually vetted by 1 or more human processes before being entered into the system
 * the record is explicit:
  * a malicious url used to deploy, control malware or exploit victims
  * a specific ip address, port and protocol combination used to control botnets
  * a specific domain, generated by a known DGA explicitly used for botnet C&C's (this does NOT mean taking the url 'http://example.com/xys.aspx' and saying "example.com is a malicious domain")
  * a specific malware sample who's binary (md5/sha1) has been vetted by a human reverse engineer OR detected by 3 or more antivirus vendor engines

= Medium =
 * denotes that the record (or feed) has a medium false positive rate
 * good chance of infection (75% or higher)
 * aggregated urls (domains) who pass an initial "whitelist" test (eg: not google.com or microsoft.com) 
 * the record is sometimes vetted by a human, normally where an actual relationship or obvious bias to the data exsts (eg: a public researcher feed, etc)
 * malware sample from a known credible feed
  * auto-generated data:
   * from a "high severity" observation (eg: a nameserver contained with the spamhaus DROP list networks list)
   * an A-record pointing to a known botnet C&C (of high severity), that passes the initial whitelist test  

= Low =
 * denotes that the record (or feed) has a high false positive rate
 * data is usually auto-generated (eg: dig -t NS when resolving a bad domain of medium or lower severity)
 * data should mostly be considered "support data" for queries and correlation activities

= <BLANK> =
 * reserved for known benign data (eg: searches, queries, passive dns data)
