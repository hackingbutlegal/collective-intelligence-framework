#summary how to migrate v0 apikeys to a v1 instance

= Introduction =

This document describes how to migrate apikeys from a v0 instance to a v1 instance. This doc assumes your v0 instance is at-least 0.06 or higher (in which the cif_apikeys utility includes export support for keys)

= Details =
== Caveats ==
 * If you've set any "access restrictions", these will not be copied over as they've been re-architected in v1.
 * this will copy over revoked keys, be sure to do adequate testing prior to releasing into production
== Migration ==
 # be sure your v0 instance is updated to 0.06 (or higher)
 # log into your v0 instance as the 'cif' user
 # export the apikeys to a file
{{{
$ /opt/cif/bin/cif_apikeys -E > ~/v0_apikeys
}}}
 # copy this file to your v1 instance (be sure to use SSH or some form of encrypted medium, your apikeys are in clear text)
 # login to your v1 instance as the 'cif' user
 # import the keys
{{{
$ /opt/cif/bin/cif_apikeys -I -L ~/v0_apikeys
}}}
