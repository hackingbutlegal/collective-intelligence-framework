== From Source ==

  * libssl-dev / openssl-devel (deb / RHEL)
  * make, automake (developer tools on OS X)

= Known Issues =
 * BSD *Performance* p5-JSON-XS will solve some performance issues
 *  *TLS* there have been reports of TLS "read" errors on older versions of REHL (5.4, etc), the cause is still unknown.
 * TLS Issues
  * if the server requires a *proxy*, some perl dep's will *fail to install*, most likely LWP::Protocol::https.
  * in some cases where LWP::Protocol::https fails to install you might see "*Can't locate object method "ssl_opts" via package "LWP::UserAgent"*"... too.
  * The work-around is to install this dep manually to bypass the connectivity tests:
{{{
$ wget http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/G/GA/GAAS/LWP-Protocol-https-6.02.tar.gz
$ tar -zxvf LWP-Protocol-https-6.02.tar.gz
$ cd LWP-Protocol-https-6.02
$ perl Makefile.PL
$ make
$ sudo make install
}}}
 *  *MacOS X 10.7* -- If you install XCode 4.3, you'll need to go to Preferences, install cmdline tools (you'll also need to reg as a developer). You should use [https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action 4.2.1] for now if you don't want to reg as developer.
