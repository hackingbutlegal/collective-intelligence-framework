=== RC1 ===
 * renamed cif-perl to libcif
 * renamed cif-dbi-perl to libcif-dbi
 * merged cif-client to libcif
 * libcif now provides (implements) cif-protocol
 * libcif now provides HTTP transport
 * renamed cif-router-perl to cif-router
 * renamed cif-smrt-perl to cif-smrt
 * misc bugfixes to cif-smrt
 * migrated Iodef::Pb to be auto-generated and implemented in Iodef::Pb::Simple
 * added simple access control to feed data-types (eg: domain, infrastructure, malware) based on apikey (eg: key can only access one of the feeds if you allow it, no query)

=== beta3 ===
 * re-architected cif-smrt for better memory + thread support via ZeroMQ
 * merged cif_analytics into cif-smrt as "postprocessors", disabled by default, enabled by use of the '-P' flag in cif_smrt
 * improved feed generation support
 * removed direct "dbi" database integration, now uses submission support in cif-client and cif-router
 * added submission support to cif-router
 * added key expiration to cif-router / cif-apikeys

=== beta2 ===
 * re-architected how feeds are generated (enabled only)
 * re-architected how ip-addresses are index'd (removed strict postgres dep)

=== beta1 ==
 * Moved from JSON to Google Protocol Buffers (protobuf)
 * added compression (compress-snappy)
 * enabled remote database connectivity
 * split out:
  * cif-perl (core cif messaging protocol)
  * cif-dbi-perl (core database interface)
  * cif-smrt (formally cif_feedparser)
  * cif-router (formally CIF::WebAPI)
 * turned cif-router into a driver framework (eg: HTTP, ZeroMQ are just plugins and can be swapped out)
 * simplified the CIF::Router api (removed severity and restriction from the api)
 * simplified the query data model, most things are now just sha1 hash lookups (with the exception of ipv4/6 addresses)
 * less "index" tables to swap in and out of memory, faster lookups, ip-addr's will follow in upcoming beta's
