 * malwaredomains.pl -- format changes to the feed. This feed changes frequently.
 * dnswl.org -- subscription only
 * any feed with an HTTPS randomly seg faults. Architectural bug in the ::SSLeay modules when it comes to threading, has to do with memory corruption and the use of global vars. Possible Ubuntu work-around:
{{{
- installed IO::Socket::SSL 1.36
- installed Net::SSLeay 1.36
- installed Crypt::SSLeay 0.58
- rebuilt openssl for ubuntu 10.10 from source (0.9.8o)
}}}
 * phishtank -- unicode errors
 * host-file.net.pl -- never finished, unknown if this feed is worth it
