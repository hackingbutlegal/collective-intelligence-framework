 * we're using postgres as an embedded db, these current configs assume your postgres instance is locked down from the outside world. if someone gets shell, they've already got your data.
 * malwaredomains.pl -- format changes to the feed. This feed changes frequently.
 * dnswl.org -- subscription only
 * any feed with an HTTPS randomly seg faults. Architectural bug in the ::SSLeay modules when it comes to threading, has to do with memory corruption and the use of global vars. Possible Ubuntu work-around:
{{{
- installed IO::Socket::SSL 1.36
- installed Net::SSLeay 1.36
- installed Crypt::SSLeay 0.58
- rebuilt openssl for ubuntu 10.10 from source (0.9.8o)
}}}
 * phishtank -- unicode (sometimes non-ascii) errors -- try with [http://code.google.com/p/collective-intelligence-framework/source/browse/tags/r0.01_03/feeds-public/src/phishtank.pl this script]
 * host-file.net.pl -- never finished, unknown if this feed is worth it
