This page discusses the Severity values for intelligence records

= Introduction =

This document defines a pain scale. These values are defined within the context of the object we're attempting to describe.

= High =
 * that this will cause you pain
 * this could be causing someone else pain (and you're participating), which could cause you pain later
 * examples include botnet infrastructure, DOS attacks, malware samples
 
= Medium =
 * this might cause you pain
 * there is no legitimate reason to see this traffic, but it might not be indicative of a compromise (by itself)
 * examples include exploit infrastructure, phishing lures, (ssh|rdp|voip) scanners
 
= Low =
 * supporting data
 * usually enumerated data
 * examples include passivedns data, searches, name-servers derived from domain data

= Null =
 * whitelists
 * could cause you pain if you act on it in-correctly (collateral damage)
 * just because something is in this category; doesn't mean it's 100% good, just means it should factor into your risk equation. Yahoo could be hosting something bad, but it might not be worth acting / blocking on. Your business risk assessments should assess this.
