#summary howto install the perl client

= Known Issues =
 1. if you have some issues installing REST::Client, please try this [http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/M/MC/MCRAWFOR/REST-Client-217.tar.gz version] until it's able to be resolved.
 1. if you're server is using an "InCommon" like certificate, some variants of Unix (OSX, etc) may not pay attention to the intermediate certificate properly. In this case, the work-around is to add the line:
{{{
[client]
host = ...
apikey = ...
verify_tls = 0
}}}
to your configuration file until this is resolved.
