#summary howto install the perl client

= Known Issues =
== BSD ==
 1. *Performance* p5-JSON-XS will solve some performance issues for you
== RedHat ==
 1. *TLS* there have been reports of TLS "read" errors on older versions of REHL (5.4, etc), the cause is still unknown.
== Proxies ==
 1. if the server requires a *proxy*, some perl dep's will *fail to install*, most likely LWP::Protocol::https. The work-around is to install this dep manually to bypass the connectivity tests:
{{{
$ wget http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/G/GA/GAAS/LWP-Protocol-https-6.02.tar.gz
$ tar -zxvf LWP-Protocol-https-6.02.tar.gz
$ cd LWP-Protocol-https-6.02
$ perl Makefile.PL
$ make
$ sudo make install
}}}
== MacOS X ==
 1. *MacOS X 10.7* -- If you install XCode 4.3, you'll need to go to Preferences, install cmdline tools (you'll also need to reg as a developer). You should use [https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action 4.2.1] for now if you don't want to reg as developer.
