#summary howto install the perl client

= Known Issues =
 1. if you have some issues installing *REST::Client*, please try version [http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/M/MC/MCRAWFOR/REST-Client-217.tar.gz 217] until it's able to be resolved.
 1. if you're using BSD, p5-JSON-XS will solve some performance issues for you
 1. there have been reports of TLS "read" errors on older versions of REHL (5.4, etc), the cause is still unknown.
 1. if the server requires a *proxy*, some perl dep's will *fail to install*, most likely LWP::Protocol::https. The work-around is to install this dep manually to bypass the connectivity tests:
{{{
$ wget http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/G/GA/GAAS/LWP-Protocol-https-6.02.tar.gz
$ tar -zxvf LWP-Protocol-https-6.02.tar.gz
$ cd LWP-Protocol-https-6.02
$ perl Makefile.PL
$ make
$ sudo make install
}}}
