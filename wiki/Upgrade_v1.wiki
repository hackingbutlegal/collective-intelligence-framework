#summary upgrading from a v0 instance

<font color="red">
Upgrades are never an exact science, and generally are not recommended unless you have the time/skills to perform them if/when things fail. We do our best to provide the utilities and doc necessarily to cover edge cases, while this will improve over time, if something goes horribly bad, it might make more sense to start fresh with a new installation and new data. This is a learning process for the project and we don't currently have the resources to debug problems that might occur during a database upgrade.

That being said, as long as you follow the directions carefully, backup your archive table (external usb-drives can be handy), you should be able to recover from a failed upgrade with out losing everything.

If you do lose everything, ... it's not the end of the world, within a few weeks, your shinny new v1 instance will have lots of data in it to make lemonade with. :)

From v0, the database upgrade primarily:

 * alters the apikeys tables
 * alters the archive table
 * drops the rest of the tables (un-needed in v1)
 * re-creates all the v1 tables around the archive table
 * converts the data in archive from json to compressed google protocol buffer blobs (v1 format)
 * re-populates the hash index table (used for searches)

There are two ways to perform an upgrade, an *'in-place'* or *'new-installation'* upgrade. Both of these options take some time as we evolve our data formats. They require that the discrete steps are followed very carefully to avoid data corruption, etc.

=== In-Place Upgrade ===
----
==== Overview ====
 * drops all v0 tables, with the exception of archive, apikeys and apikeys_groups
 * alters the archive and apikeys tables to be compatible with v1
 * does NOT alter the archive and index tablespaces
 * creates the v1 tables around the archive table (in the index tablespace)
 * <font color="red">EXPORT YOUR ARCHIVE TABLE TO A TEMPORARY DISK (lots of GB's)</font>

==== Prepare ====

==== Data Migration ====
 # run the upgrade-database utility that will convert the existing archive data into the new v1 format, as well as any feeds to be generated. 
  * <font color="red">if you haven't backed up the archive table, this is a good time to do it.</font>
  * this will take a very long time to run (hours, days depending on how much data you have)
  * if the process breaks, it keeps a journal (/tmp/cif-upgrade-database.journal) of where it left off and will re-start where it left off
{{{
$ cd libcif-dbi/
$ perl sbin/migrate-data.pl -t 4 -d -C /home/cif/.cif
}}}
 # when this is completed, continue on to the [ServerInstall_v1#Router_Setup router setup]

=== New Installation Upgrade ===
----
 * this requires a new installation of v1 on a separate host
 * this requires a copy of the existing archive table file to be made available to the new installation
 * this option takes a little longer as a data-export / import is required
 * depending on the size of your archive tablespace, it could require extra temporary space to do the export (eg: a fast, external usb drive is handy in these cases if your network is too slow for moving large files around easily)
 * <font color="red">MAKE SURE YOUR CLOCK TIMEZONE IS IN-SYNC (UTC) ACROSS BOTH HOSTS</font>

There are two ways to handle this type of upgrade:

 * cut off all services, run the upgrade, turn on all services
 * split the migration into two different exports, the first for the bulk of the historical data, the second for the data absorbed by the system from that point on

For a split migration, the dual-staged data-export will look something like:
{{{
$ psql -U postgres -d cif
psql> COPY (select uuid,guid,format,created,data from archive WHERE created <= '2012-06-01T23:59:59Z' AND format = 'iodef' AND description NOT LIKE '% feed') TO '/mnt/<my_large_disk>/cif.sql' WITH binary;
}}}

where the 'created' timestamp is a cutoff date sometime in the past (eg: "yesterday"). something easily pointed to in the next export for the official cutover:

{{{
$ psql -U postgres -d cif
psql> COPY (select uuid,guid,format,created,data from archive WHERE created > '2012-06-01T23:59:59Z' AND format = 'iodef' AND description NOT LIKE '% feed') TO '/mnt/<my_large_disk>/cif.sql' WITH binary;
}}}

==== Details ====
 # follow the v1 [ServerInstall_v1 install] instructions until you get to the "Load Data" section
 # import the archive copy to your current v1 database (could take a long time)
{{{
$ psql -U postgres -d cif
psql> COPY archive (uuid,guid,format,created,data) FROM '/mnt/<my_large_disk>/cif.sql' WITH binary;
}}}
 # run the migrate-data utility that will convert the existing archive data into the new v1 format, as well as any feeds to be generated. 
  * this will take a very long time to run (hours, days depending on how much data you have)
  * if the process breaks, it keeps a journal (/tmp/cif-upgrade-database.journal) of where it left off and will re-start where it left off
{{{
$ cd libcif-dbi/
$ perl sbin/migrate-data.pl -t 4 -d
}}}
 # if you're doing this as a split process, repeat these steps with the new data (the process will remember where to start with the /tmp/cif-upgrade-database.journal file)
