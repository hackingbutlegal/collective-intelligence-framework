#summary upgrading from a v0 instance

= Introduction =

* pre-v0 instances (xml) are not supported
* this upgrade assumes latest v0 instance (v0.06)

= Details =

There are two ways to perform an upgrade, in-place and new installation. 

== In-Place Upgrade ==

The libcif-dbi/sbin/upgrade-database.pl utility:

 * does NOT alter the archive and index tablespaces
 * drops all v0 tables, with the exception of archive, apikeys and apikeys_groups
 * alters the archive and apikeys tables to be compatible with v1
 * creates the v1 tables around the archive table (in the index tablespace)

== New Installation Upgrade ==
