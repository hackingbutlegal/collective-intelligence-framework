----
A semi-complete [https://github.com/collectiveintel/cif-v1/blob/master/ChangeLog ChangeLog] of v1

A list of known [https://github.com/collectiveintel/cif-v1/issues issues] for v1

== Backwards Compatibility ==
 * as of v1, the 'CIF-Client' is now part of the client side library 'libcif'
 * the deprecated "CIF::Client" (via CPAN) cannot be used with a v1 instance
 * the v0 client *MUST* be [ClientRemoval_v0 removed] first if it's installed

== Caveats ==
 * libcif cannot be installed via CPAN at this time
 * libcif provides:
  * CIF::Client library to build (perl) applications against
  * the 'cif' command
  * by default, is installed to '/opt/cif', can be changed with the '--prefix' flag when running './configure'
 * to build applications in other languages, simply pipe the 'cif' command with '-p json' which will pipe stripped down (non-iodef) json key-pairs to your application
 * currently, libcif defaults to the /opt/cif environment due to it's perl nature
 * future versions of libcif will be written in a lower level language (more portable) and provide high level language bindings
 * a sample python client can be found [https://github.com/collectiveintel/cif-client-python/tree/v1 here]
